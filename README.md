## "Machine Learning" certification program by Stanford University and Coursera

- This program by Andrew Ng provides a broad introduction to machine learning, data-mining and statistical pattern recognition. What I like most about this program is that it teaches theoretical underpinnings of machine learning and provides practical know-how needed to apply machine learning techniques.
- Topics covered in this program:
    - Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks)
    - Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning)
    - Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI).
